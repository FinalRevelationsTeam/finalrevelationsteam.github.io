*Traits* are passive modifiers that a character can achieve. They can be leveled up using *Trait Points (TP)* to increase the *Rank* of a trait. Most traits have *24* ranks (*F-* to *A+*, *S-* to *S+*, *SS*, *SSS*, *God*), but certain traits like [[Transformation]] traits have a variable number of ranks. Traits may also unlock [[Skills]] when a prerequisite is met.

*Prowess Traits* are a type of trait that can be unlocked through leveling up other traits. These are often much more powerful than a normal trait and can greatly affect the playstyle of a character.
