*Magic* is a system similar to [[Technology]].

## Spells ##
### Enchantment ##
Enchantment can only be used on weapons, giving them unique bonuses.

All enchantments are rolled randomly.
1-3 random enchantment effects can be rolled on an item depending on the item Grade.
* *Common* # Not Enchanted
* *Rare* # 1 Enchantment
* *Super* # 2 Enchantments
* *Legendary* # 3 Enchantments

A player can spend mana to increase an item's grade, which also increases the range of values for the enchantment effects.
Mana can be spent to imbue the item, which raises the values of all the enchantment effects the item currently possesses to the maximum possible value for that grade. An imbued item cannot be re-rolled or further modified.
