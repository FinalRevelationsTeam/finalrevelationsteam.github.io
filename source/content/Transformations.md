A *Transformation* is a special type of [[Buffs|Buff]] that is almost always unique to a race. Transformations typically have modifiers and abilities that are far beyond even Unique buffs. Each race has at least one transformation. Some races have a permanent transformed state, while others have a temporary toggleable transformation.

To achieve a transformation, a character has to meet the required Battle Power and be able to power up to meet the transformation tier. For example, Super Saiyan — a Tier *1* transformation — requires reaching past a character's first powerup breakpoint in order to transform. When a transformation is mastered, this requirement is no longer necessary.
