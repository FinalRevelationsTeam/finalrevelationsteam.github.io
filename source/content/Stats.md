*Stats* represent the basic fighting abilities of a character. Each stat has a *Stat Modifier*, or *Stat Mod* associated with it, which multiplies the stat's effectiveness. There are *trainable* stats and *non-trainable* stats. Trainable stats can be raised by performing different training activities. Non-trainable stats cannot normally be raised, but their stat mods adjusted by [[Buffs]], [[Transformations]], and in some cases [[Traits]]. Raising any trainable stat gives the character *Trait Points* (*TP*), which can be used to raise Trait ranks.
# Stat Descriptions #

## Basic Stats ##

### Health ###
Health represents a character's current vitality. If Health reaches *0*, the character is knocked out.

### Stamina ###
Stamina is the main resource your character utilizes for skills, blocking, attacking, or movement techniques. Stamina regenerates passively. Any attack action performed by a character will stop their Stamina regeneration for *1* second. At *0* Stamina, a character is slowed down until their Stamina regenerates.

### Wounds ###
Wounds represent the long-term battle damage of a character. A character's Health cannot exceed their Wounds. When a character takes damage, they lose at base *10%* of that damage in Wounds. So long as a character is above 15% wounds, they can join combat. If a character is below 5% wounds and knocked out while in combat, they will stay down until the combat is finished.

### Fatigue ###
Fatigue is the long-term exhaustion of a character. A character's Energy cannot exceed their Fatigue. Fatigue cannot be regenerated in combat.  When a character expends Energy, they lose at base *10%* of that energy in Fatigue.


## Trainable Stats ##
### Strength ###
Strength largely influences the power of Physical attacks. It also factors into the weight a character can carry.

### Durability ###
Durability largely influences damage taken from Physical attacks. It also factors into the weight a character can carry.

### Force ###
Force largely influences the power of Ki attacks.

### Resistance ###
Resistance largely influences damage taken from Ki attacks. 

### Offense ###
Offense determines the accuracy of a character's attacks.

### Defense ###
Defense determines the rate at which a character dodges.

### Energy ###
Energy determines the total amount of energy a character has, which is drained from many buffs and skills. Training this stat does not give the character Trait Points.

### Battle Power ###
Battle Power is a multiplier for each stat and determines how effective a stat is. Training this stat does not give the character Trait Points.

## Non-Trainable Stats ##
### Speed ###
Speed affects a character's attack rate, movement speed, charge rate, power-up rate, and the damage of speed-based skills.

### Regeneration ###
Regeneration determines the rate at which a character heals Health and Wounds, and how long it takes for them to get up after being knocked out.

### Recovery ###
Recovery determines the rate at which a character heals Energy and Fatigue, the energy drain of certain skills and buffs, and the power-up breakpoint percentage for each power-up tier.

### Anger ###
Anger is a multiplier on top of Battle Power, typically activated when under *50%* Health, although many Skills, Buffs, or Traits can affect how it activates.
