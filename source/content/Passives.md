A *Passive* is similar to a [[Traits|Trait]], in that it gives passive bonuses to a character. The main difference is that a Passive cannot be leveled up, does not have a rank, and cannot be bought through *Trait Points (TP)*, usually being unlocked through specific means. Passives are also not necessarily permanent.
