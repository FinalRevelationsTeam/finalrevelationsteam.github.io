## Unique Buffs

### Kaioken
![[Pasted image 20250807224941.png]]  
This buff changes the user's [[Skills#Power Control|Power Control]] skill. While active, powering up raises Kaioken's level and powering down decreases it. Each level of Kaioken automatically sets the user's powerup percentage to *20<sup>1+((level-1)*0.05)</sup>%*, draining [[Stats#Health|Health]] instead of [[Stats#Energy|Energy]]. Activating this buff halves the power loss from low [[Stats#Health|Health]]. This buff also disables activating a [[Transformations|Transformation]].

### Flow State
![[Pasted image 20250807225029.png]]  
This buff summons a variable amount of intangible copies that follow the user's movement. Each time the user attacks, the clones attack as well, with a delay dependent on the sequence number of the clone. The clones' attacks have all the same stats and modifiers of the user. Each attack that a clone makes drains *5* [[Stats#Stamina|Stamina]].

### Limit Breaker
![[Pasted image 20250807224951.png]]  
This buff removes all power loss from low [[Stats#Energy|Energy]], adding an adjustable amount of power to the user's powerup percentage.
