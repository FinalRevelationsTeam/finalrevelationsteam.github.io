*Buffs* are skills, usually toggleable, that can increase or decrease [[Stats|Stat]] modifiers. They are separated into *Unique* and *Common* buffs. Only one Unique buff can be used at a time. However, any number of Common buffs can be used at once. [[Transformations]] are a type of buff with special properties. There are also *Racial* buffs that can be Common or Unique. These are typically associated with certain [[Races]], but in some cases can be learned by members outside of that race.

| Type | Levels |  BP  | Strength | Durability | Force | Resistance | Offense | Defense | Speed | Recovery |
|:----:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:----------:|:-----:|:----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-----:|:--------:|
|  1   |   2    | 1.3  |    -     |     -      | 1.25  |     -      |   1.1   |  1.15   |   -   |    -     |

### Unique Buffs ###
#### Kaioken ####
This buff changes the user's [[Skills#Power Control|Power Control]] skill. While active, powering up raises Kaioken's level and powering down decreases it. Each level of Kaioken automatically sets the user's powerup percentage to *20<sup>1+((level-1)*0.05)</sup>*%, draining Health instead of Energy. Activating this buff halves the power loss from low Health. This buff also disables activating a Transformation.

#### Flow State ####
This buff summons a variable amount of intangible copies that follow the user's movement. Each time the user attacks, the clones attack as well, with a delay dependent on the sequence number of the clone. The clones' attacks have all the same stats and modifiers of the user. Each attack that a clone makes drains *5* Stamina.
#### Limit Breaker ####
This buff removes all power loss from low Energy, adding an adjustable amount of power to the user's powerup percentage.
